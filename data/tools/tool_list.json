    "description": "\n    Search your conversation history and long-term memories using hybrid vector + BM25 search.\n    Default searches collapsed segment summaries that synthesize entire conversations.\n    Also supports searching your long-term memories with semantic similarity and keyword matching.\n    Returns results with confidence scores. For conversations, get time boundaries to drill into details.\n    \n\n    This tool has three primary operations:\n\n    1. search: Find information in segment summaries (default), messages, or memories\n       - Required: query (what to search for)\n       - Optional: search_mode (\"summaries\", \"messages\", \"memories\"), entities, max_results, page\n       - For search_mode=\"messages\": REQUIRES start_time AND end_time parameters\n       - For search_mode=\"memories\": Searches long-term memories with hybrid vector+BM25\n       - Returns: Segment summaries, message previews, or memories with confidence scores\n\n    2. search_within_segment: Search messages within a specific segment\n       - Required: segment_id (8-char ID from summary search)\n       - Optional: query (to filter within segment), max_results\n       - Returns: All messages from that segment, optionally filtered\n\n    3. expand_message: Get full content of a specific message with context\n       - Required: message_id (first 8 characters of UUID)\n       - Optional: direction (\"before\", \"after\", \"both\"), context_count\n       - Returns: Full message content plus surrounding messages\n\n    SEARCH STRATEGY (Summary Mode - Default):\n    - Hybrid search combining vector similarity and BM25 text ranking\n    - Vector search uses 384-dim embeddings for semantic matching\n    - BM25 search on summary text for keyword precision\n    - Combined score: weighted combination of vector similarity and text relevance (configurable)\n    - Returns collapsed segment summaries with full conversation synthesis\n    - Supports temporal direction with reference_time:\n      * before: Find segments earlier than reference_time\n      * after: Find segments later than reference_time\n      * around: Find segments within \u00b17 days of reference_time\n\n    SEARCH STRATEGY (Message Mode - Requires Timescope):\n    - Direct BM25 search on message content\n    - MUST provide start_time and end_time to bound the search\n    - Use this after finding relevant segments for detailed quotes\n\n    SEARCH STRATEGY (Memory Mode):\n    - Hybrid search combining vector similarity (AllMiniLM 384d) and BM25 text ranking\n    - Searches your long-term memories (extracted insights, facts, preferences)\n    - Returns memories with importance scores, timestamps, and link counts\n    - No time boundaries required - searches all memories\n    - Supports pagination for browsing through results\n\n    PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE:\n    - Start with segment summaries (dense, synthesized information)\n    - Each summary includes time boundaries and confidence score\n    - Use search_within_segment to drill into specific segments\n    - Use expand_message for full context around specific messages\n\n    CONFIDENCE LEVELS:\n    - High (\u22650.70): Summaries contain clear matches to your query\n    - Medium (0.40-0.69): Relevant segments found, may need to search within\n    - Low (<0.40): Consider refining query or entities\n\n    The calling LLM should:\n    - Always start with summary search (most efficient)\n    - Extract entities/proper nouns before searching\n    - Use segment time boundaries to search for specific details\n    - Only use message mode when you have specific timescopes\n    ",

    "description": "\n    WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:\n\n    Use getcontext_tool proactively whenever the conversation implies there might be relevant\n    context beyond what's currently in working memory. Since the tool returns instantly and\n    searches in the background, there's minimal cost to invoking it.\n\n    Invoke freely when:\n    - User references something from the past (\"remember when...\", \"like we discussed...\")\n    - User asks about topics that might have prior context\n    - Conversation shifts to a new topic where historical context could be relevant\n    - You're unsure if you have complete information on a topic\n    - User asks questions that might benefit from web information\n    - You want to proactively gather context while continuing the conversation\n\n    Examples of queries:\n    - \"What have we discussed about machine learning projects?\"\n    - \"Taylor's work schedule and preferences\"\n    - \"Everything about the home automation system\"\n    - \"API redesign decisions\"\n    - \"Recent news about quantum computing\" (will search web)\n    - Simple topic queries work fine - agent handles complexity internally\n\n    DO NOT USE when:\n    - You need synchronous results immediately (use continuumsearch_tool instead)\n    - Searching within a specific known time range (use continuumsearch_tool with timescope)\n    - Information is already in current working memory\n\n    HOW IT WORKS:\n\n    The tool launches an autonomous search agent that runs in the background:\n\n    1. **Immediate Return**: Tool returns instantly with a searching indicator in the context window\n    2. **Autonomous Planning**: Agent decomposes query into search strategy\n    3. **Iterative Search**: Agent searches conversations, memories, web as needed\n    4. **Smart Completion**: Agent determines when sufficient context is gathered\n    5. **Automatic Summary**: Results appear in context window with findings and sources\n\n    Search runs for up to 5 minutes. Agent makes intelligent decisions about what sources\n    to search and when to stop based on findings.\n\n    SEARCH MODES:\n    - standard (default): Stops when key information is found (faster, focused)\n    - deep: Exhaustive search across all sources (comprehensive, takes longer)\n\n    SEARCH SCOPE:\n    By default searches all available sources. Can be limited:\n    - conversation: User's conversation history\n    - memory: Long-term memories\n    - web: Current web information\n\n    RESULTS:\n    - Appear asynchronously in a context window in working memory\n    - Show pending status (\ud83d\udd0d) while searching\n    - Display summary with key findings, confidence scores, and sources when complete\n    - Show timeout/failure messages if search encounters issues\n    ",
