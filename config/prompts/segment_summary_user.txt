Summarize the following conversation segment using the two-component format: a rich 2-3 sentence synopsis followed by an 8-word display title.

## Conversation:
{conversation_text}

## Tools Used:
{tools_used}

Generate your response in exactly this format:

```
[Your 2-3 sentence synopsis here - include entities, technical details, actions, outcomes]

<mira:display_title>[Your 8-word or shorter telegraphic title here]</mira:display_title>
<mira:complexity>[1, 2, or 3 based on cognitive complexity]</mira:complexity>
```

Remember: The synopsis should be searchable and detailed. The display title should be scannable and concise. The complexity score should reflect information density and cognitive load (1=simple, 2=moderate, 3=complex). The `<mira:display_title>` and `<mira:complexity>` tags will be automatically stripped from the synopsis.
